# Share-Data-Through-the-Art-of-Visualization
Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data.

## Four key elements or building blocks of Data Visualization:
#### The information or data 
#### The story 
#### The goal
#### The visual form

The four elements of effective data visualization are the information or data, the story, the goal, and the visual form; a successful data visualization must have all four elements. 

Bar graphs use size contrast to compare two or more values. This type of visualization makes it very easy to identify patterns.

Line graphs are a type of visualization that can help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data.

Pie charts show how much each part of something makes up the whole.

Maps help organize data geographically. The great thing about maps is they can hold a lot of location-based information and they're easy for your audience to interpret.

To avoid misleading visualizations, always start Y - axis at 0.

In a bar graph, The x-axis is a horizontal line used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables. The y-axis is a vertical line that usually has a scale of values for variables.

Time series charts: Change over time is a big one. If your analysis involves how the data has changed over a certain period, which could be days, weeks, months, or years. You can set your visualization to show only the time period relevant to your objective. 

A histogram resembles a bar graph, but it's a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges. Each bin or bucket, as the bar is called, contains a certain number of values that fall into one small part of the range.

Ranked bar chart: Bar charts with horizontal bars effectively show data that are ranked, with bars arranged in ascending or descending order. 

Correlation charts can show relationships among data, but they should be used with caution because they might lead viewers to think that the data shows causation.

Causation or a cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome.

Correlation and causation are often mixed up because humans like to find patterns even when they don't exist. If two variables look like they're associated in some way, we might assume that one is dependent on the other. That implies causation, even if the variables are completely independent. If we put that data into a visualization, then it would be misleading. But correlation charts that do show causation can be effective.

Static visualizations do not change over time unless they're edited. These visualizations are often made on excel sheets where the visualization is backed up with static data. *** There is no interactive or dynamic feature in these kinds of visualizations. ***

Dynamic visualizations are interactive or change over time. Which means when you click a part of the visualization a new segment may pop out. That's interactivity or dynamic nature of visualization. Use BI tools like Tableau or PowerBI for that. Also, there are some visualizations which are completely dependent on data changes with time. These types of visualizations automatically get updated when the the data changes.

Tableau is a business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data. Visualizations in Tableau are automatically interactive.

It's good to remember that the more power you give the user, the less control you have over the story you want the data to tell. You have to find the right balance between interactivity (dynamic nature) and control (static nature).

#### The elements of data visualization art are line, shape, color, space and movement.

Colors can be described by their hue, intensity, and value. 

The hue of a color is basically its name, red, green, blue and so on.

Intensity is how bright or dull a color is.

The value is how light or dark the colors are in a visualization. Value indicates how much light is being reflected.

Dark values with some black added are called shades of color.

Light values with white added are called tints.

Data Composition => Combining the individual parts of a visualization and displaying them together as a whole.

#### 3 Elements for Effective Visuals:
The first is clear meaning, good visualizations clearly communicate their intended insight. The second is a sophisticated use of contrast, which helps separate the most important data from the rest using visual context that our brains naturally look for. The third essential element for effective visuals is refined execution. Visuals with refined execution include deep attention to detail, using visual elements like lines, shapes, colors, value, space and movement.

Design thinking is a process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way. User-centricity means considering the user and their needs first.

#### Design thinking for data visualization involves five phases:
1. Empathize: Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualization 
2. Define: Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data
3. Ideate: Generating ideas for data visualization
4. Prototype: Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
5. Test: Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

A headline is a line of words printed in large letters at the top of a visualization to communicate what data is being presented. It is the attention grabber that makes your audience want to read more.

A subtitle supports the headline by adding more context and description. Adding a subtitle will help the audience better understand the details associated with your chart. Typically, the text for subtitles has a smaller font size than the headline.
