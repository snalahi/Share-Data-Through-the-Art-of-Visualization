# Share-Data-Through-the-Art-of-Visualization
Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data.

## Four key elements or building blocks of Data Visualization:
#### The information or data 
#### The story 
#### The goal
#### The visual form

The four elements of effective data visualization are the information or data, the story, the goal, and the visual form; a successful data visualization must have all four elements. 

Bar graphs use size contrast to compare two or more values. This type of visualization makes it very easy to identify patterns.

Line graphs are a type of visualization that can help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data.

Pie charts show how much each part of something makes up the whole.

Maps help organize data geographically. The great thing about maps is they can hold a lot of location-based information and they're easy for your audience to interpret.

To avoid misleading visualizations, always start Y - axis at 0.

In a bar graph, The x-axis is a horizontal line used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables. The y-axis is a vertical line that usually has a scale of values for variables.

Time series charts: Change over time is a big one. If your analysis involves how the data has changed over a certain period, which could be days, weeks, months, or years. You can set your visualization to show only the time period relevant to your objective. 

A histogram resembles a bar graph, but it's a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges. Each bin or bucket, as the bar is called, contains a certain number of values that fall into one small part of the range.

Ranked bar chart: Bar charts with horizontal bars effectively show data that are ranked, with bars arranged in ascending or descending order. 

Correlation charts can show relationships among data, but they should be used with caution because they might lead viewers to think that the data shows causation.

Causation or a cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome.

Correlation and causation are often mixed up because humans like to find patterns even when they don't exist. If two variables look like they're associated in some way, we might assume that one is dependent on the other. That implies causation, even if the variables are completely independent. If we put that data into a visualization, then it would be misleading. But correlation charts that do show causation can be effective.

Static visualizations do not change over time unless they're edited. These visualizations are often made on excel sheets where the visualization is backed up with static data. *** There is no interactive or dynamic feature in these kinds of visualizations. ***

Dynamic visualizations are interactive or change over time. Which means when you click a part of the visualization a new segment may pop out. That's interactivity or dynamic nature of visualization. Use BI tools like Tableau or PowerBI for that. Also, there are some visualizations which are completely dependent on data changes with time. These types of visualizations automatically get updated when the the data changes.

Tableau is a business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data. Visualizations in Tableau are automatically interactive.

It's good to remember that the more power you give the user, the less control you have over the story you want the data to tell. You have to find the right balance between interactivity (dynamic nature) and control (static nature).

#### The elements of data visualization art are line, shape, color, space and movement.

Colors can be described by their hue, intensity, and value. 

The hue of a color is basically its name, red, green, blue and so on.

Intensity is how bright or dull a color is.

The value is how light or dark the colors are in a visualization. Value indicates how much light is being reflected.

Dark values with some black added are called shades of color.

Light values with white added are called tints.

Data Composition => Combining the individual parts of a visualization and displaying them together as a whole.

#### 3 Elements for Effective Visuals:
The first is clear meaning, good visualizations clearly communicate their intended insight. The second is a sophisticated use of contrast, which helps separate the most important data from the rest using visual context that our brains naturally look for. The third essential element for effective visuals is refined execution. Visuals with refined execution include deep attention to detail, using visual elements like lines, shapes, colors, value, space and movement.

Design thinking is a process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way. User-centricity means considering the user and their needs first.

#### Design thinking for data visualization involves five phases:
1. Empathize: Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualization 
2. Define: Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data
3. Ideate: Generating ideas for data visualization
4. Prototype: Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
5. Test: Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

A headline is a line of words printed in large letters at the top of a visualization to communicate what data is being presented. It is the attention grabber that makes your audience want to read more.

A subtitle supports the headline by adding more context and description. Adding a subtitle will help the audience better understand the details associated with your chart. Typically, the text for subtitles has a smaller font size than the headline. 

A diverging palette displays two ranges of values using color intensity to indicate magnitude. Intensity is a color’s brightness or dullness.

#### A dashboard is a tool that organizes information, typically from multiple data sets, into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization through charts, graphs, and maps. 

#### Data storytelling is communicating the meaning of a data set with visuals and a narrative that are customized for each particular audience.

Speaking of business communications, one of the many ways that companies use visualization to tell data stories, is with word clouds. Word clouds are a pretty simple visualization of data. These words are presented in different sizes based on how often they appear in your data set. It's a great way to get
someone's attention and to unlock stories from big blocks of text where each word alone could never be seen. Word clouds can be used in all sorts of ways. On social media, they can show you which topics show up in posts most often, or you can use them in blogs to highlight the ideas that interest readers the most. 

Spotlighting is scanning through the data to quickly identify the most important insights. A data analyst uses spotlighting to pinpoint the most relevant data derived from their analysis and eliminate the less important details. 

Filtering means showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest.

#### Keep Only => option on the chart can be used to filter out data points.

#### An effective data narrative includes characters, a setting, a plot, a big reveal, and an aha moment.

A good rule is to keep texts to less than five lines and 25 words per slide while presenting.

#### An important use-case for data storytelling
A data analyst includes a visual in their presentation to represent information from a dataset. It’s important that the visual reflect the latest information, so the analyst wants it to update automatically if the original dataset changes. They should link the visual to its original file.

#### Strorytelling is Presentation (like slide presentations)

You will want to / need to establish the initial hypothesis. Your initial hypothesis is a theory you're trying to prove or disprove with data. 

Heatmap => A map with different colors, where the color intensity represents severity.

**********
A correlation coefficient is a measure of strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. So in other words, the closer to one (1) that the number is, the more positively correlated they are. Meaning, when one of the variables goes up, so does the other one. The closer to negative one (-1) that the number is, the more negatively correlated they are. Meaning, as one of the variables, such as happiness, goes up that the other variable like health would go down. And the closer to zero (0) it is, it means they are not correlated at all, which is what we saw between population and happiness, and means that they have no relationship together.

#### Good data presentation (Key Points):
- Title and date the presentation was last updated
- Flow or table of contents
- Transition slides 
- Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme)
- Animated bullet points
- Annotations on top of visuals
- Logic and progression 
- Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data can’t tell you

An effective slideshow guides your audience through your main communication points, but it does not repeat every word you say. A best practice is to keep text to fewer than five lines and 25 words per slide.
